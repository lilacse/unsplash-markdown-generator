Generates Markdown code to embed Unsplash images. 

Currently a rough draft and a direct reimplementation of the [old script](https://github.com/lilacse/unsplash-markdown-generator/blob/legacy/get-md.elv). Improvements are coming <3

### Usage Requirements

1. Your own [Unsplash API key](https://unsplash.com/developers). Only the access key is required.

### Development Dependencies

1. Python 3.7+
2. PySide6 (`pip install PySide6`)
3. Requests (`pip install requests`)

PySide6 should come with the QT-related dependencies for development (QT designer, uic.exe), but setting them up for convenient use will be dependent on your setup.
